        You deserve someone who loves you with every single beat of his heart, someone who thinks about you constantly,
        someone who spends every minute of every day just wondering what you’re doing, where you are, who you’re with,
        and if you’re OK. You need someone who can help you reach your dreams and protect you from your fears.
        You need someone who will treat you with respect, love every part of you, especially your flaws.
        You should be with someone who could make you happy, really happy, dancing on air happy.❤️
